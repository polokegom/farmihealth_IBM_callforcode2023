# CNN Models used:
There were 3 models trained & tested
1. A plant detection model using Yolov8 model & PlantVillage dataset used to detect sign of blight (model failed to perform to expectation).
2. A pest detection model using Yolov8 model & pest dataset used to detect sign of pests such as beetles on crops (model failed to perform to expectation).
3. A weed detection model trained which successfully detected weeds; However, gave false reading depending on the vegetation (citation: ), This model was deployed on IBM Watson ML
